    <h1>What i like the most : Chilling with Nanii</h1>
    <p><img src="../jaurelle/images/goodtimewithdaughter.jpg" alt="Nani and I"></p>
    <p>Naomie is literally the best thing that ever happened in my life. She gave me a second chance in life, a second chance to pursue my objectives, to enjoy life again, to love, to see things differently. Spending time with her takes away all the frustrations life may have brought to me. Juste holding her in my hands make me feel alive again and ready to overcome any challenges. Watching her smile brings such an indescribable feeling. I love her from the bottom of my heart and all I hope is that she will understand this sacrifice I made by staying away from her for two years. </p>
