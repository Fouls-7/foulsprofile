    <h1>My interest</h1>
    <p><img src="../jaurelle/images/daughter.jpg" alt=""></p>
    <p>I live a pretty quiet life, when Iâ€™m not studying, am working. But l like some activities like travelling and visiting cities with skyscrapers because those inspire me as an engineer. I also enjoy cooking food, especially discovering foreign dishes. But above all that, what I love the most in this live is spending some good time with my lovely daughter.That's why her image is on the top of this page </p>
